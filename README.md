# card-triage

## My approach

Here is my submission for the homework requested.

I used React for the development. I did not use any CSS library. Lastly, I just added a link to a google font (*Roboto*)

I approached the project by implementing the movement of cards between boards throughout  a *drag and drop* feature.

I followed thoroughly the idea of changing the status **only** from pending/rejected to done and from done to rejected (thus, it is not possible to switch between pending-rejected or change from done to pending).

## Feedback

The project was fun, thanks to it I learned a few new things.
However, the instructions weren't that clear to me (for example, if a third "rejected" column could have been added or not. Or if "rejected" had to be part of the "pending" or "done" cards).
To conclude, it took me 5h12min.
